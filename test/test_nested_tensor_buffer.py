        # because it is not a leaf variable. So, if we call unbind
        # on a NestedTensor to retrieve one of its constiuents, should
        # that be a leaf variable or a view?
        # Further, if the NestedTensor has a buffer, the constiuents are
        # views of that buffer, so that means unbind() needs to return views
        # in either case.

        # When I set requires_grad_ for a NestedTensor and this NestedTensors becomes
        # a leaf in an autograd graph it'll have a .grad field. If I call unbind on
        # this NestedTensor I should get a list of views. However, if constructed
        # with as_nested_tensor I'll get a list of Tensors, i.e. the Tensors used
        # to actually build the NestedTensor, which are then all leaf variables
        # (since requires_grad_ is forwarded to its constiuents since .grad()
        # on the constiuents is used to construct NestedTensor.grad)
